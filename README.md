# Friday Night Funkin': Kade Engine Reboot

Kade Engine Reboot aims to 'reboot' Kade Engine's legacy, by updating and optimizing it.
All the hardcoding is back. Now, I know hardcoding isn't quite optimal in terms of storage, but fuck it. I love Kade Engine.
Modcore and Stepmania stuff has been removed. You can re-enable them by uncommenting them in Project.xml, but I don't guarrantee they will work.

### I'm not sure if I'm going to enable contributions, since I barely even know how to use Git and GitHub.
### If you want to build the engine, read [this](https://github.com/Bloctey64/Kade-Engine-Reboot/building.md).

Come on, everybody knows about it.

## Kade Engine

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

If you're looking for documentation, changelogs, or guides, you can find those on the Kade Engine website. (or can you?)
